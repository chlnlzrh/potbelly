# **Critical Build Information Not Captured in Action Items**

## **Material Specifications & Standards**

### **Bar Area**

- **Tile Type:** Handmade custom tiles (casting in progress)
- **Bar Back Configuration:** POV (point of view) design with integrated wallpaper and shell racks
- **Veneer Application:** Above bar area installation ongoing

### **Liquor Storage Room**

- **Wall Treatment:** Black lacquer glass with decorative design curtain (approved concept)
- **Purpose:** Creates visual focal point visible from main restaurant; allows light transmission
- **Shelving:** Stainless steel (SS) shelving system for liquor storage
- **Current Status:** Temporarily used as general storage during construction

### **Kitchen Specifications**

- **Ducting Route:** Exhaust duct must run from kitchen to terrace level
- **Equipment Status:** All new equipment fabricated and ready; awaiting site preparation
- **Integration:** Existing equipment from previous location to be reconditioned and integrated
- **Layout Coordination:** Joint meeting required between Arushi (design), Kitchen Equipment Vendor, and operations team
- **Base Work:** Kitchen structure (base, trap, waterproofing) estimated 10 days to completion

### **Washing Area (Critical Operational Zone)**

- **Function:** Primary washing station for all crockery, cutlery, glassware
- **Enclosure:** Bison board structure
- **Flooring:** Kota stone (order pending)
- **Tile Application:** Commercial tiles over bison board base
- **Ventilation:** Two wall-mounted fans with dedicated electrical points
- **Facade Visibility:** External wall visible from restaurant requires aesthetic treatment
- **Status:** Will be fully enclosed with proper drainage

### **Bathroom Configuration**

**Downstairs Bathroom:**

- **Tile Type:** Commercial grade tiles
- **Future Use:** May convert to storage room (flexible design)
- **Current Priority:** Basic functional completion

**Upstairs Bathroom (Main Floor):**

- **Status:** Near completion
- **Remaining Work:** Fixtures, skirting, final finishing
- **Priority:** Primary functional bathroom for operations

**Terrace Bathroom:**

- **Skirting:** In progress
- **Special Equipment:** RO (reverse osmosis) water filtration system to be installed inside due to space constraints
- **Function:** Service bathroom for terrace dining area

### **Terrace Level Specifications**

**Structural/Waterproofing:**

- **Critical Issue Resolved:** Fire fighting water tank floor level 3 inches below terrace level causing water accumulation
- **Fix Status:** Contractor has implemented temporary solution
- **Pending:** Landlord reimbursement and permanent fix confirmation
- **Flooring Process:** Waterproofing → Grouting → Machine buffing
- **Paint Specification:** Waterproof exterior-grade texture paint (white)

**Roofing System:**

- **Type:** Tensile fabric (seamless installation required)
- **Design Status:** Approved and ready for installation
- **Purpose:** Weather protection for terrace dining area

**Glass Enclosure:**

- **Window Type:** Sliding aluminum or MS frame (material pending Arushi decision)
- **Rationale:** Enables easy cleaning access and cross-ventilation
- **Color Matching:** Frame color to match existing aesthetic
- **Maintenance Priority:** Opening mechanism chosen over fixed glass for practical cleaning access

**Terrace Access & Ambiance:**

- **Stairwell Treatment:** Wallpaper or photographic treatment proposed to create inviting visual path from restaurant
- **Signage:** Eye-catching signage at stairwell entrance (both sides) with dedicated electrical point
- **Purpose:** Drive customer traffic to terrace dining area

### **Sequencing & Dependencies**

**Critical Path Sequence:**

1. **Scaffolding Installation** (Thursday, Oct 24) → Enables ceiling work
2. **Kitchen Ducting** (Friday, Oct 25) → Requires scaffolding completion
3. **Painting Start** (Friday, Oct 25) → 5-day window for all painted surfaces
4. **Acoustic Installation** (Post-painting) → Prevents dust/paint absorption by fabric panels
5. **Electrical Fixtures** (Nov 1-2) → Requires painted/clean surfaces
6. **Kitchen Equipment** (Post-Diwali, ~Nov 5) → Requires completed kitchen structure

**Parallel Work Streams:**

- Door fabrication (Sabharwal) ongoing off-site
- Fixed furniture fabrication ongoing off-site
- Tile work in bathrooms
- Terrace waterproofing and finishing
- Design decisions by Arushi

## **Vendor Coordination Requirements**

### **Immediate Coordination Needed:**

- **Joint Finishes Meeting:** Arushi + all vendors to finalize material selections (glass frame, terrace finishes, liquor storage, stairwell)
- **Kitchen Layout Meeting:** Arushi + Kitchen Equipment Vendor + Operations Team to confirm equipment placement and existing equipment integration
- **Landlord Communication:** Submit photographic evidence and cost documentation for terrace repair reimbursement

### **Quality Control Notes:**

- **Painting Timeline:** 5-day window is aggressive; requires crew size confirmation and daily progress monitoring
- **Dust Management:** All door and furniture work happening off-site to minimize on-site dust before painting
- **Cleaning Protocol:** One round of cleaning before painting; second round post-painting before acoustic installation
- **Material Matching:** All finishes must coordinate with overall design aesthetic (veneer, paint colors, tile selections)

## **Outstanding Design Decisions (High Priority)**

All items require Arushi's input before vendor orders can proceed:

1. **Terrace glass frame material:** MS vs. Aluminum (color matching required)
2. **Terrace wall finish:** Paint type and color specification
3. **Liquor storage room:** Final approval of black lacquer glass design
4. **Washing area facade:** Treatment for restaurant-visible exterior wall
5. **Stairwell visual treatment:** Wallpaper vs. photographic installation

**Impact of Delay:** Each pending decision blocks corresponding vendor orders and installation scheduling, creating cascading delays on critical path.

## **Operational Readiness Considerations**

### **Functional Zones:**

- **Bar Area:** Requires veneer, tiles, wallpaper, shell racks completion before service-ready
- **Kitchen:** Equipment installation post-Diwali creates hard constraint on kitchen commissioning timeline
- **Washing Area:** Critical for operations; must be 100% complete and tested before opening
- **Bathrooms:** Upstairs bathroom must be fully functional; downstairs can remain basic initially
- **Terrace:** Weather-dependent; roofing and waterproofing must be flawless for all-season operation

### **Safety & Compliance:**

- **Fire Safety:** Fire fighting tank drainage issue must be permanently resolved
- **Electrical:** All points must be tested and certified before final fixture installation
- **Ventilation:** Kitchen exhaust and washing area ventilation critical for health/safety compliance
- **Waterproofing:** Terrace and bathroom waterproofing must pass inspection before final finishes
